PROJECT 31: BABY BLACKJACK
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Implement a simplified version of Blackjack where a player and the dealer draw two cards each from a deck with values ranging from 1 to 10. 
- The one with the higher total card value wins the round.

Main Tasks:
1. Create a 'DrawCard' method to generate a random number between 1 and 10, simulating a card draw.
2. Call 'DrawCard' twice for the player and twice for the dealer, storing these values in variables.
3. Compare the total values of the player's and dealer's cards to determine the winner.
4. Display the cards drawn and announce the winner.
5. Ask the user if they want to play again; if yes, repeat the process; if no, end the program.
6. Make sure you use methods and comment your code!

Extension Tasks:
1. Keep track of and display the number of rounds won by the player and the dealer.
2. Integrate a betting system allowing the user to place a bet before each round and keep track of their total money.
3. (Harder) Generate a list of cards and remove each card as it is drawn to simulate an actual deck of cards.
