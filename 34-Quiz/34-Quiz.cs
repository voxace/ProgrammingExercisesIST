PROJECT 34: QUIZ
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Create a multiple-choice quiz application in C#.
- Implement a custom class to model a question and possible answers.
- Utilize a collection to store and manage a set of questions.
- Navigate through the quiz using a menu and loop system.

Main Tasks:
1. Create a class named 'Question' with properties to store the question text, four possible answers, and the index of the correct answer.
2. Create methods within the 'Question' class to:
   a. Display the question and possible answers.
   b. Check if a given answer is correct.
   c. Provide feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
3. In the Main method, create a list or an array to hold instances of the 'Question' class.
4. Populate the list or array with a set of questions and answers to form the quiz.
5. Implement a menu system in a loop to navigate through the quiz:
   a. Display the current question and possible answers.
   b. Prompt the user to select an answer or move to the next/previous question.
   c. Provide feedback on the correctness of the user's answer.
   d. Allow the user to exit the quiz.
6. Keep track of the user's score throughout the quiz.

Tips:
- Utilize a List or array to manage the collection of questions.
- Consider using a switch statement or if-else constructs to handle user input for navigating the quiz and answering questions.
- You may use a loop to continue displaying the menu and questions until the user chooses to exit.

Extension Tasks:
1. Implement a feature to allow users to create their own quiz within the program.
2. Implement features to save and load quizzes from a file.
