            // We can then perform some mathematical operations on it. E.g. addition with +
            
            Console.WriteLine("X plus Y = " + (x + y));

            // 5. Wait for input before ending

EXTENSION TASKS:

1. Modify the program to work with the 'double' type
2. Use Google to work out how to get the remainder of a division using the 'modulus operator'


QUESTIONS:
        
1. What does "float.Parse" do?



2. What is a parameter? Give an example of where you have used one.



3. Why is the 'Console.ReadLine()' a parameter to float.Parse?




EXAMPLE:

This is what the final program output might look like:

  Please enter a number for X:
  7
  Please enter a number for Y:
  3
  X plus Y = 10
  X times Y = 21
  X minus Y = 4
  X divided by Y = 2.333333


WHEN FINISHED:

1. Click the Save All button
2. Go to http://www.peergrade.io to submit this Program.cs file
3. Give feedback to two of your classmates, and review the feedback you have received
4. If the feedback suggests that there is room for improvement, you may come back and modify your code / answers
