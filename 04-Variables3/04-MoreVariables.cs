PROJECT 04: MORE VARIABLES
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Understand and practice creating and using variables to store and manipulate data.

Main Tasks:
1. This program has 3 errors that you can fix by creating some variables.
   Create the correct variables using 3 different data types so that the WriteLine statement outputs:
   "As of 2016 the population of China was 1.379 billion."

Questions:
1. Why were the words "year", "country", and "population" originally underlined?
2. What is the purpose of the dollar sign ($) before the double quotes in the final message?

Extension Tasks:
1. Print out another statement using three or more new variables of different data types.
2. Find out how to include "double quotes" in a string using an "escape character".
3. Find out how to round down or change the display format of a number using ".ToString()".
