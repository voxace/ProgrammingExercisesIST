PROJECT 10: NUMBER OPERATIONS 2
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Enhance understanding of user input, selection, and performing mathematical operations based on user choices.

Main Tasks:
1. Prompt the user to enter values for variables 'X' and 'Y'.
2. Ask the user to choose a mathematical operation (Add or Subtract), and store the choice in a string variable.
3. Utilise selection statements to perform the chosen operation and output the result.

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Console.ReadLine() and Console.ReadKey()?
2. Why is the choice stored as a string instead of an integer?

Extension Tasks:
1. Research online to learn how to perform exponentiation, e.g., X to the power of Y.
2. Research online to learn how to use the 'ToString()' function to round the answer to two decimal places.

Example:
- Below is an example of the program's output:

    Please enter a number for X:
    7
    Please enter a number for Y:
    3

    What would you like to do:
    1. Addition
    2. Subtraction

    1 

    The answer is: 10
