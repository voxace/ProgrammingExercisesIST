PROJECT 09: PICK A DOOR
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Practice using selection statements with multiple conditions to control program flow based on user input.

Main Tasks:
1. Prompt the user to pick a door by entering a number (1, 2, or 3), and store the result in a string variable.
2. Use a selection statement (if...else if...else) to determine and output what is behind each door.
3. Print a warning message if the user picks something other than 1, 2, or 3.
4. Wait for input before ending the program.

Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the final ELSE statement in this program?
2. What is the difference between the = operator and the == operator?

Extension Tasks:
1. Use more else if statements to create more doors.
2. Customise the program to output a personalised message to the user (e.g., including their name).
3. Research online to learn how to generate a random number, and use this number to pick a door for the user.

Example:
- Below is an example of the program's output:

    Pick a Door: 1, 2 or 3
    2
    You win a Car!
