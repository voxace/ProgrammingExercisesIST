PROJECT 11: AREA CALCULATOR
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Enhance understanding of selection, user input, and maths operations by calculating areas of different shapes based on user choices.

Main Tasks:
1. Create a menu that asks the user to choose between calculating the area of a rectangle or triangle.
2. Prompt the user for their choice and store it in a variable.
3. Using selection, complete the program to calculate the area of either rectangles or triangles
4. Handle invalid menu choices with a warning message.
5. Create a "Press any key to exit..." message at the end of the program.

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Console.Write() and Console.WriteLine()?
2. How is the area of each shape calculated? What mathematical operations are used?

Extension Tasks:
1. Extend the program to calculate the area of other shapes and add them to the menu. E.g. Circle, trapezium.

Example:
- Below is an example of the program's output:

    Choose an Option:
    1. Area of Circle
    2. Area of Rectangle
    3. Area of Triangle

    2

    Enter Width: 3
    Enter Height: 4

    The area of the rectangle is 12

    "Press any key to exit...
